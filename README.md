Timecard is a simple iOS/Web system for tracking what you do the old
fashioned way -- punch in, punch out.

## Features

* _Quick Configuration_ -- Get up and running fast. Register online or
  through the phone, add some tasks, and punch in!
* _Daily History_ -- Timecard remembers all punches and groups them by
  day. Punch in and out as often as you like; a running total for the
  day will appear.
